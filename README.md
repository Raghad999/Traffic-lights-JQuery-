## Due date/time:  This assignment is due tonight at midnight


When you have finished it might be a good idea to chip away at your project!  Were you inspired by anything you learned today about jQuery?  Have any cool ideas for how we can use jQuery events, animations, etc. to make your page more interactive and engaging?  Experiment a little!  Work on some more CSS!  Start working on the content!  Getting a little done tonight will save yourself time later.

4 days until it is due!
